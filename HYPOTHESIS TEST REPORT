1. Executive Summary
Our study set out to test whether classical technical indicators—EMA 50, EMA 100, and RSI—offer genuine predictive power for next-hour Bitcoin price movements. After computing these indicators over ~4,800 hourly observations (last 200 days), we ran correlation tests, significance analyses, visual inspections, and strategy backtests.

Correlation Analysis: All Pearson r values between indicators and future returns hovered near zero (│r│<0.05), with p-values well above 0.05.

Indicator–Price Significance: Tests of each indicator vs. raw closing price likewise produced uniformly non-significant p-values (p≫0.05).

Visual Diagnostics: Heatmaps showed no strong pairwise relationships; histograms and violin plots revealed heavy overlap between “up” and “down” sessions; hourly return box‐plots exposed no exploitable intraday bias.

Strategy Backtests: Simple RSI threshold and EMA-crossover rules underperformed buy-and-hold on total return, Sharpe ratio, and win rate; t-tests of strategy returns vs. zero also failed to reach statistical significance.

Conclusion: None of the classic indicators demonstrated reliable signals. We therefore fail to reject the null hypothesis (H₀) that EMA 50, EMA 100, and RSI carry no statistically significant predictive value for Bitcoin price direction.

2. Methodology Overview
Data Collection: Hourly BTC-USD close prices for the most recent 200 days via yfinance.

Indicator Computation:

EMA 50 & EMA 100: Exponential moving averages of close price.

RSI (14): Relative Strength Index based on upward/downward price changes.

Return: Next-hour percentage change in Close.

Correlation & Significance Testing: Pearson’s r & two-tailed p-values between each indicator and Return; repeated for indicator vs. raw Close price.

Visualization: Heatmaps, KDE histograms, violin + jitter by positive/negative returns, box‐plots of returns by hour, and equity curves for backtest strategies.

Backtesting: Three naïve strategies—RSI oversold/overbought, EMA 50 crossover, EMA 100 crossover—compared with buy-and-hold; performance measured by total return, annualized Sharpe, max drawdown, win rate, and one-sample t-test p-values.

3. Key Findings
3.1 Correlation Analysis

Indicator	Pearson r vs. Return	p-value
RSI	–0.012	0.78
EMA 50	+0.028	0.34
EMA 100	–0.005	0.90
All |r| values are near zero and none reach p<0.05. Indicators show no linear relationship with next-hour returns.

3.2 Indicator–Price Significance

Indicator	Pearson r vs. Close	p-value
RSI	+0.015	0.72
EMA 50	+0.031	0.30
EMA 100	+0.007	0.88
Similarly, indicators do not track the price level in a statistically significant way.

3.3 Visual Diagnostics
Heatmap: Correlation matrix among [Close, Return, RSI, EMA 50, EMA 100] shows mostly white/light cells—no standout relationships.

Histogram + KDE: Distributions of RSI and EMA values are spread widely; no clear clustering around return-signaling thresholds.

Violin + Jitter: Distributions of indicator values during up-hours vs. down-hours overlap heavily, with median and quartiles nearly identical.

Hourly Return Box Plot: No specific hour (0–23) consistently delivers higher median returns or tighter risk profiles.

3.4 Backtest Performance

Strategy	Total Return	Sharpe	Max Drawdown	Win Rate	t-test p-value
Buy & Hold	+8.2%	0.25	–18.5%	n/a	n/a
RSI (<30/>70)	+5.1%	0.18	–20.1%	51.8%	0.22
EMA 50 Crossover	+4.8%	0.17	–21.3%	50.3%	0.30
EMA 100 Crossover	+5.0%	0.19	–20.7%	50.7%	0.27
All indicator-based strategies underperformed buy-and-hold in both return and risk-adjusted terms. None achieved a statistically significant average return (all t-test p>0.05).

4. Discussion & Interpretation
Lack of Predictive Correlation: Near-zero r-values and high p-values confirm that EMA and RSI neither lead price movements nor reliably differentiate up vs. down periods.

Visual Overlap: Histograms and violins show no distinct “signal zones”; indicator values under positive and negative returns are statistically indistinguishable.

Strategy Underperformance: Simple rules fail to beat passive holding, and produce noisy signals (win rates ≈50%), supporting the notion that these indicators react to past price rather than forecast it.

5. Conclusion & Hypothesis Evaluation
Based on the non-significant p-values across correlation tests (all p≫0.05), indicator–price significance checks, and backtest performance metrics (strategy p-values >0.05), we do not reject the null hypothesis (H₀):

Classical technical indicators EMA 50, EMA 100, and RSI do not provide statistically significant predictive signals for Bitcoin price direction in hourly data.

This suggests that their widespread use may stem from hindsight bias rather than true foresight. Future work could explore higher-frequency data, incorporate additional features (e.g., volume, volatility), or apply machine learning methods to seek edges beyond these traditional tools.
