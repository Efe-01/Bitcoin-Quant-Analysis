Analysis Report: The Impact of Classical Technical Indicators on Bitcoin Prices
Hypothesis
"Classical technical indicators (EMA50, EMA100, and RSI) do not have a statistically significant effect or correlation with Bitcoin price movements."

Data Analysis and Results
1. Correlation Analysis
RSI:

Pearson correlation: 0.256 (p = 1.49e-33)

Spearman correlation: 0.217 (p = 2.90e-24)

Conclusion: RSI exhibits a weak but statistically significant positive relationship with price movements.

EMA50 and EMA100:

Both indicators show Pearson and Spearman correlations around -0.04, with p-values >0.05.

Conclusion: No significant correlation exists between EMA indicators and price.

2. OLS Regression Model
Model Performance:

RÂ² = 0.070 (The model explains only 7% of the variance).

RSI coefficient: 9.27e-05 (p = 0.000), EMA50: -5.25e-07 (p = 0.001), EMA100: 5.14e-07 (p = 0.002).

Conclusion: RSI has a statistically significant positive impact on returns. While EMA coefficients are statistically significant, their practical relevance is negligible.

Warning: The model shows multicollinearity (Condition No. = 1.64e+06), likely due to the inclusion of highly correlated EMAs.

3. Strategy Performance
Sharpe Ratios:

RSI: -0.735, EMA50: -1.165, EMA100: -1.256.

Conclusion: All strategies underperform the market, with negative risk-adjusted returns.

P-Values:

RSI: 0.661, EMA50: 0.488, EMA100: 0.454.

Conclusion: The returns of these strategies are likely due to random chance.

4. Mutual Information
RSI: 0.055, EMA50: 0.048, EMA100: 0.055.

Conclusion: Weak information transfer between indicators and returns.

5. Overbought/Oversold Tests
Overbought vs Neutral: t = 6.36 (p = 2.45e-10).

Oversold vs Neutral: t = -9.60 (p = 2.46e-21).

Conclusion: RSI extremes are statistically distinct from neutral conditions but fail to translate into profitable signals.

Key Insights
RSI shows a statistically significant but weak relationship with price movements. However, this does not result in profitable strategies (negative Sharpe ratio).

EMA50 and EMA100 have no meaningful correlation or predictive power over Bitcoin prices.

All technical strategies underperform a simple Buy & Hold approach.

Multicollinearity in the regression model suggests overlapping information between EMA50 and EMA100.

Conclusion
The hypothesis is partially validated:

EMA50 and EMA100 show no significant impact on prices.

RSI exhibits statistical significance but lacks practical utility.

Technical indicators alone are insufficient for profitable trading. They must be combined with other factors (e.g., fundamental analysis, macroeconomic data).
