# Bitcoin-Quant-Analysis
# Bitcoin Market Analysis Project

## Project Overview

In this project, I will analyze Bitcoin price movements using both classic technical indicators and quantitative (quant) trading data. My goal is to determine whether quant data—such as the True Retail Ratio, Whale vs. Retail Ratio, and Top Traders' Long/Short Ratio—provides a more accurate signal for price direction compared to traditional technical indicators like EMA 50, EMA 100, and RSI.

By collecting and analyzing data over a specific period, I aim to assess how market makers influence price action and whether retail traders systematically face disadvantages in the market. Additionally, I want to investigate the true success rate of top traders and evaluate the reliability of classical technical analysis when compared with quant data, ultimately producing a complex and comprehensive analysis of market behavior. The project will utilize data from Hyblock for quant metrics and TradingView for technical indicators.

## Objectives

1. **Compare Technical Analysis vs. Quant Data**  
   Evaluate the effectiveness of classical technical indicators (EMA 50/100, RSI) versus quantitative trading data in predicting Bitcoin price movements.

2. **Analyze Market Maker Influence**  
   Investigate how market makers may act against retail traders and whether quant data can reveal these patterns.

3. **Evaluate Top Traders' Success Rate**  
   Assess how often top traders' long/short positions align with accurate market direction.

4. **Identify Market Manipulation**  
   Determine whether significant price movements align with retail trader positioning, indicating potential manipulation.

5. **Data-Driven Strategy Development**  
   Use insights from this study to identify potential improvements in market analysis and trading strategies.

## Motivation

This project aims to bridge the gap between traditional technical analysis and modern quant trading approaches. Understanding the interplay between retail and whale traders, as well as the effectiveness of different market signals, can provide deeper insights into Bitcoin price action. Additionally, by analyzing real trading behavior, we can challenge the conventional wisdom of technical indicators and investigate whether market manipulation is a significant factor.

## Dataset

I will collect data from the following sources:

- **Hyblock** (Quant Data):
  - True Retail Ratio
  - Whale vs. Retail Ratio
  - Top Traders' Long/Short Ratio
- **TradingView** (Technical Indicators):
  - EMA 50
  - EMA 100
  - RSI
- **Bitcoin Price Data**: Historical price action and volume trends

All data will be recorded and processed for trend analysis and correlation studies.

## Tools and Technologies

To analyze the data, I will use:

- **Python**: For data processing and statistical analysis
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization (correlation heatmaps, time series, scatter plots)
- **NumPy & SciPy**: Statistical tests and regression analysis

---

## Analysis Plan

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
   - Extract historical data from Hyblock and TradingView.
   - Clean and organize data into a structured format for analysis.

2. **Visualization & Correlation Analysis**  
   - Compare price trends with quant metrics and technical indicators.
   - Generate correlation heatmaps to identify key relationships.

3. **Hypothesis Testing**  
   - Test the hypothesis:
     - **H₀**: Quant data does not offer better directional accuracy than technical indicators.
     - **Hₐ**: Quant data provides stronger predictive power than traditional indicators.
   - Use regression analysis to determine the most predictive factors.

4. **Pattern Recognition & Trend Analysis**  
   - Analyze how market makers react to retail positioning.
   - Evaluate the success rate of top traders’ long/short positions.
   - Investigate whether large price movements align with retail trading behavior, indicating possible market manipulation.

## Example Analysis

To illustrate the approach, I will conduct the following analyses:

1. **Retail vs. Whale Positioning Analysis**  
   - Compare price movements against the True Retail Ratio and Whale vs. Retail Ratio.
   - Identify patterns where market reversals coincide with extreme retail positioning, suggesting possible stop-loss hunting or market maker intervention.

2. **Technical Indicator vs. Quant Signal Accuracy**  
   - Track the success rate of EMA 50/100 and RSI-based predictions versus quant-based signals (such as the Top Traders' Long/Short Ratio).
   - Determine which approach provides more accurate trade signals over time.

3. **Top Traders’ Long/Short Success Rate**  
   - Analyze how often top traders' positions align with profitable market movements.
   - Evaluate whether following top traders provides a viable trading edge.

4. **Market Manipulation Indicators**  
   - Identify instances where significant price movements appear to be triggered by liquidation events or retail-heavy positioning.
   - Determine if these events correlate with price trends, suggesting strategic market manipulation by whales or institutions.

## Expected Insights

By the end of this project, I aim to answer the following questions:

- Are quant metrics more reliable than classic technical indicators for price prediction?
- How do market makers position themselves against retail traders?
- How effective are top traders' long/short decisions?
- Is there evidence of systematic market manipulation in Bitcoin trading?
- Can a quant-based approach improve trading strategies?

This project will provide valuable insights into Bitcoin market dynamics, helping traders better understand the forces that drive price movements. By analyzing these data points, I aim to develop a structured approach to my own trading journey, refining my methods based on data-driven insights and continuously improving my market strategies.
