I recognize that our current analysis—focused mainly on indicator thresholds and their immediate impact on next-hour price moves—may still be too narrow. To tap into the market’s true dynamics, we should visualize the raw time-series data itself: think rolling heatmaps of price and volume, phase-space plots of price versus momentum, or even animated 3D charts. These approaches let us see the data’s own structure—regime shifts, clustering, and anomalies—that static summary statistics can easily obscure.
Also maybe some data analyze parts lead false informations but like I said, I can really improved my data analysis with machine learning stratiges. 

Looking ahead, combining these richer, data-driven visuals with machine-learning methods could uncover non-linear patterns or hidden market regimes that simple correlation tests miss. By broadening our toolkit in this way, we can sharpen our insights—and perhaps even revisit our p-value results—to more clearly determine whether EMA and RSI truly offer any predictive edge.

I also want to note that I revised the README: my initial plan was to compare classical technical indicators with quantitative trading data, but the latter proved prohibitively expensive to obtain. As a result, I redirected our focus to a more in-depth, advanced analysis of traditional technical indicators. I believe that by layering machine-learning on the raw dataset, we may not only enrich our visual exploration but also potentially alter our hypothesis conclusions.
